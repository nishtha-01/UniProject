								<h1>Design and Analysis of Algorithms</h1>
								<p align="justify" style="font-weight: bold;">
								Design and Analysis:</p>
								<p>An algorithm is a set of steps of operations to solve a problem performing calculation,
								data processing, and automated reasoning tasks. An algorithm is an efficient method that 
								can be expressed within finite amount of time and space.</p>
								<p align="justify" style="font-weight: bold;">
								Algorithm Design:</p>
								<p>An algorithm is the best way to represent the solution of a particular problem in a 
								very simple and efficient way. If we have an algorithm for a specific problem, then we can 
								implement it in any programming language, meaning that the algorithm is independent from 
								any programming languages.
								</p>
								<p align="justify" style="font-weight: bold;">Characteristics of Algorithms
									The main characteristics of algorithms are -</p>

								<p>Algorithms must have a unique name.</p>

								<p>Algorithms should have explicitly defined set of inputs and outputs.</p>

								<p>Algorithms are well-ordered with unambiguous operations.</p>

								<p>Algorithms halt in a finite amount of time. Algorithms should not run for infinity, i.e., an algorithm must end at some point.</p>

								<h1>Theory of Computation</h1>
								<p align="justify" style="font-weight: bold;">The computational theory is approached through three main fields:</P>

									<p>1. Automata theory</p>

									<p>2. Computability theory</p>

									<p>3. Computational complexity theory</p>
									<p>These three branches basically uses algorithms to exploit the powers
									of computers in solving problems.</p>
									<p style="font-weight: bold;">Automata theory:</p>

									<p>This branch was established in the 20th century by mathematicians. The main aim in 
									this branch is to analyze the behavior of machines and how they solve a problem.The most 
									powerful model of automata is the Turing machine.</p>
									
									<p style="font-weight: bold;">Computability theory:</p>

									<p>It is when we are able to formulate the problem using the Turing machine easily,
									but we can never solve it.. In other words, It is when the computer is able to address
									the problem but unable to come up with the solution.</p>


									<p style="font-weight: bold;">Computational complexity theory:</p>

									<p>The complexity theory discusses the efficiency at which a problem could be solved.
									This is done considering two major aspects:- time complexity and space complexity, 
									which are the measurees of the number of steps needed to analyze and solve the problem
									and thus determining the memory space needed to solve the problem.</p>

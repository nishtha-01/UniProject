								<h1>Computer Architecture and Organisation</h1>
								<p align="justify">Computer architecture deals with the design of computers, data storage
								devices, and networking components that store and run programs, transmit data, and drive 
								interactions between computers, across networks, and with users. Computer architects use
								parallelism and various strategies for memory organization to design computing systems with
								very high performance. Computer architecture requires strong communication between computer 
								scientists and computer engineers, since they both focus fundamentally on hardware design.
								<p>At its most fundamental level, a computer consists of a control unit, an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), 
								a memory unit, and input/output (I/O) controllers. The ALU performs simple addition, subtraction, multiplication,
								division, and logic operations, such as OR and AND. The memory stores the programâ€™s instructions and data. The control 
								unit fetches data and instructions from memory and uses operations of the ALU to carry out those instructions using that data.
								(The control unit and ALU together are referred to as the central processing unit [CPU].) When an input or output instruction 
								is encountered, the control unit transfers the data between the memory and the designated I/O controller. The operational speed
								of the CPU primarily determines the speed of the computer as a whole. All of these components - the control unit, the ALU, 
								the memory, and the I/O controllers - are realized with transistor circuits.</p>
								<p>Computers also have another level of memory called a cache, a small, extremely fast
								(compared with the main memory, or random access memory [RAM]) unit that can be used to
								store information that is urgently or frequently needed. Current research includes cache
								design and algorithms that can predict what data is likely to be needed next and preload it 
								into the cache for improved performance.</p>
